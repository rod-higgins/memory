# Getting Started

Welcome to the Personal Memory System! This guide will help you get up and running quickly.

## What is the Personal Memory System?

The Personal Memory System (PMS) is your personal AI-powered memory assistant. It stores, organizes, and retrieves information about you and your work, making every AI interaction more relevant and personalized.

**Key benefits:**
- **Remember everything** - Store facts, preferences, and context
- **Smart retrieval** - Find relevant memories using natural language
- **AI enhancement** - Get personalized responses from any AI assistant
- **Complete privacy** - All data stays on your machine

## First Steps

### 1. Log In

When you first access the web interface at `http://localhost:8765`, you'll see the login screen.

1. Enter your username and password
2. If this is your first login, you'll be prompted to set up two-factor authentication (2FA)
3. Scan the QR code with Google Authenticator or a compatible app
4. Enter the 6-digit code to complete setup

**Important:** Save your backup codes in a secure location. You'll need them if you lose access to your authenticator app.

### 2. Explore the Interface

The interface has several main sections accessible from the left sidebar:

| Icon | Section | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| Brain | My AI | Chat with AI assistants using your memory context |
| Database | Memories | Browse and manage your stored memories |
| Plug | Connections | Connect data sources for automatic ingestion |
| Code | LLMs | Configure large language model providers |
| Chip | SLMs | Manage local small language models |
| Users | Admin | User management (admin only) |

### 3. Add Your First Memory

The simplest way to start is to add a memory manually:

1. Click the **Memories** tab in the sidebar
2. Click the **Add Memory** button
3. Enter information about yourself, like:
   - "I prefer Python for data processing"
   - "I work as a software developer at Acme Corp"
   - "My favorite programming editor is VS Code"
4. Add relevant tags to help organize
5. Click **Save**

### 4. Try the AI Assistant

1. Click the **My AI** tab
2. Type a question in the chat box
3. The AI will respond using your stored memories as context

Try asking: "What do you know about me?" or "What are my preferences?"

## Quick Tips

1. **Be specific** - "I prefer tabs over spaces in Python" is better than "I like tabs"
2. **Add context** - Include domain tags like "programming", "work", "personal"
3. **Review regularly** - Check the Memories tab to ensure accuracy
4. **Let it learn** - The more you use it, the better it understands you
